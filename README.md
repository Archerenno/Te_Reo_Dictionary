<h1>Te Reo Dictionary</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This website has been designed to be used as community created Te Reo Dictionary. In this project there is a profile system, with two types of users, students and teachers. When logged in as a student (or not logged in at all), the user has access to all words but cannot make any changes. However, if the user is logged in under a teacher profile, there is a new admin page accesible by the navigation which can be used to add new words. Furthemore, words can also be removed by teacher users. All users and words in the dictionary are stored in databases and queries are used to access information needed for the programme
